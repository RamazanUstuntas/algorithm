/*Ea[c]h new term in the Fibona[c][c]i sequen[c]e is generated by adding the previous two terms. 
By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 1, [2], 3, 5, [8], 13, 21, [34], 55, 89, [144] ...
a  b  [c]  a  b  [c]  a   b   [c]   a   b   [c]

By [c]onsidering the terms in the Fibona[c][c]i sequen[c]e whose values do not ex[c]eed four million,
find the sum of the even-valued terms.*/
